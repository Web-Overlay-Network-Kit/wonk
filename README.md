# the Overlay Network Kit
A cluster of libraries useful for building overlay networks in the browser.

All code in this repo is licensed MIT-0, but the git submodules and Rust dependencies have their own licenses - hence why there are currently no distributed artifacts.  Once things settle down, I intend to reduce / eliminate these dependencies and then publish un-encumbered distributable artifacts.
